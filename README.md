## 🔍 About
[Rasa](https://rasa.com/) is the most popular open source framework for building chat and voice-based AI assistants. The `rasa-model-report` is a unofficial Rasa add-on.

The project was created to facilitate the work of developers and curators of Rasa chatbots. Rasa provides a lot of valuable data that can be "faceted" and extract different information about the training model. This information makes it possible to discover problems in the training model. The `rasa-model-report` does just that, it extracts this information to be displayed more clearly in a report.
