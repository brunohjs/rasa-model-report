## üîç About
[Rasa](https://rasa.com/) is the most popular open source framework for building chat and voice-based AI assistants. The `rasa-model-report` is a unofficial Rasa add-on.

The project was created to facilitate the work of developers and curators of Rasa chatbots. Rasa provides a lot of valuable data that can be "faceted" and extract different information about the training model. This information makes it possible to discover problems in the training model. The `rasa-model-report` does just that, it extracts this information to be displayed more clearly in a report.

You can find planned enhancements for project in the [Project Board](https://github.com/users/brunohjs/projects/2).

## üìú Changelog
Changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/brunohjs/rasa-model-report/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). You can also follow the [releases](https://github.com/brunohjs/rasa-model-report/releases) on Github.


## üì¶ Installation

This module is distributed via [Pypi](https://pypi.org/) and is required to use **Python v3.10** or higher. To install the package, use the command:
```
pip install rasa-model-report
```


## üöÄ Execution
Before anything, is necessary to have the reports generated by the `rasa test` command. To run the program, use the command:
```
rasa-model-report
```
This command must be used in the root of your Rasa project. Otherwise, you can use `--path` parameter to pass the project path.

### Step-by-step
This is the step-by-step guide for using rasa-model-report in your project.
1. Go to the root folder of your Rasa project.
2. Train model on your Rasa project, using `rasa train` command.
3. Run Rasa end-to-end tests, using `rasa test` command.
4. Run Rasa Model Report, using `rasa-model-report` command.
5. The result will be in the `model_report.md` file generated in the project root folder.

## ü¶æ Rasa Version Support
Not every version of Rasa is supported. Check the table below:
|Rasa version|Supported|
|:-:|:-:|
|3.X|‚úÖ|
|2.X|‚úÖ|
|1.X|‚ùå|
|0.X|‚ùå|


## ‚öôÔ∏è Options
There are parameters that can be used. Available options are below:

|Parameter|Description|Type|
|-|-|-|
|`--path`|Rasa project path. (default: ./)|string|
|`--output-path`|Report output path. (default: ./)|string|
|`--project`|Rasa project name. It's only displayed in the report. (default: My project)|string|
|`--version`|Rasa project version. It's only displayed in the report for project versioning. (default: not-identified)|string|
|`--rasa-api`|Rasa API URL. Is needed to create NLU section of report. (default: http://localhost:5005)|string|
|`--disable-nlu`|Disable processing NLU sentences. NLU section will not be generated in the report. Required Rasa API. (default: false)|-|
|`--help`|Show help message.|-|

### Usage examples
Some usage examples with parameters:
- Without parameters is usually used at the root of the Rasa project.
    ```
    rasa-model-report
    ```
- When you aren't at the root of the project, use `--path` parameter.
    ```
    rasa-model-report --path /path/to/rasa/project
    ```
- Aren't at the root of the project and without NLU report.
    ```
    rasa-model-report --path /path/to/rasa/project --disable-nlu
    ```
- Aren't at the root of the project and change the output directory.
    ```
    rasa-model-report --path /path/to/rasa/project --output-path path/to/place/report
    ```

## üíª Development
For development, it's suggested to create an environment using the [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#basic-installation). To create new environment, use the command:
```
mkvirtualenv rasa-model-report --python 3.10
```
After that, your new environment will already be activated. If not, to activate just use the command:
```
workon rasa-model-report
```

### Installation
To install the development environment, use make command:
```
make install-dev
```
or use `pip install`:
```
pip install . -r requirements.txt -r requirements.dev.txt
```
